# EmbeddedSystems-Assignment1

An embedded system is a lightweight, cheap and small controlling device that has a specific purpose. The
cycle of developing an embedded system goes by writing the program in assembly or embedded c, then
loading it by a development kit, after that the embedded system is used without the development kit.
In this assignment, you are required to use your Arduino board with a LED and a photoresistor. The
phitoresistor is able to capture the intensity of light. Your program should light up the led, when it is
dark and turn off the led when it is bright,
- Configure any pin as an input with a pull up resistor.
- Configure any pin as an output using Assembly using ATMEL Studio (see how to connect ATMEL
studio to Arduino development kit on the MET website).
- Burn the code using the Arduino kit.
- Complete the minimal circuit on your breadboard with values demonstrated below.
- Connect the remaining components and the power supply.
